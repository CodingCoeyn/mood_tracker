# Mood Tracker


## Goals
Record daily mood and graph the fluctuations over time. The goal is to track & anticipate changes in mood.

## Stack
Frontend: React, D3.js <br>
Server: Express, Node <br>
Database: PostgresQL <br>
ORM: Sequelize

## How it works

Each daily record is called a Diem. Each Diem records the date created, user's current mood & current condition.<br>
The user will go to their dashboard & see a list of past diems and a graph that plots out the records from the first to the most recent. Records can be filtered by the last week, month, or year.
